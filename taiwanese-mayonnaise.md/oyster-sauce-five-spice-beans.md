# Oyster Sauce Five Spice Beans

## Ingredients
* 2 cups dry soybeans
* 1/2 tsps salt
* 1 tsp five spice powder
* 2 tbsps oyster sauce
* 2 tbsps sugar
* 2 tbsps oil

## Method
Soak and boil soybeans as instructed by the [pulses](pulses) page, except with water just enough to cover the beans. Add all the ingredients except oil into the bean boiling water.

When the beans are cooked, add oil and stir fry on medium heat until the beans are of desired dryness. This step (and the oil) can also be skipped, if you prefer soft and moist beans.
