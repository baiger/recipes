# Sugars and Sweeteners

In this article, sugars refer to culinary additives that consist mainly of mono- and disaccharides. They taste sweet and, like other carbs, supply 4.2 kcal/g of energy.

Sweeteners, in this article, are sweet additives that are not included in the above category. Artificial or natural, sweeteners generally provide a lot fewer calories than sugars.

## Nutrition

Different sugars are not significantly different in their nutritional values. They only contain trace amount of micronutrients. At the amount they're normally consumed, the contents of micronutrients make little difference. Unrefined sugars (e.g., cane sugar) are not better than refined sugars (e.g., granulated white sugar) in this regard.

Sweeteners generally provide significantly less energy at the same sweetness level compared with sugars. The micronutrients they contain, if any, are also trace amounts at best.

These substances don't metabolize the same way. Glucose can be directly used by all cells, while fructose has to be processed mainly in the liver; these two also affect insulin secretion differently. Some artificial sweeteners, such as sugar alcohols, are not absorbed but rather linger in the GI tract, so overconsumption of them can cause diarrhea by osmosis. This is similar to what lactose does to lactose intolerant people.

## pH

Although unrefined and refined cane sugars aren't nutritionally different, you might still have to think twice before substituting them in recipes. The key difference is that unrefined cane sugars (brown sugar and molasses) are slightly acidic, while refined, white sugar is pH neutral. Pay attention to recipes calling for baking soda and/or baking powder. Since baking soda is slightly basic, it has to be balanced with something acidic -- in some recipes, that is brown sugar or molasses. If you substitute white sugar for them, make sure to use baking powder instead.

## Hygroscopicity

Sugars are hygroscopic, meaning they help retain moisture in food during and after cooking. Some moist cakes are very sweet. When you substitute sugars by sweeteners in these recipes, you might need to make adjustments such as adding more liquid or covering the pan while baking.
