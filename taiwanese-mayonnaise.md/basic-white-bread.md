# Basic White Bread

## Ratio
* **Flour** 100%
* **Water** 60-80%
* **Salt** 2%
* **Yeast** 1-2%
* Fat 0-5%
* Sugar 0-5%

## Method
Mix dough. Knead until [windowpane test] is passed. Let rise to double the size. Punch down. Shape and let rise again to about 50% bigger. Bake.

### Shaping

### 2nd Rise

### Baking

Preheat oven to 450&deg;F/230&deg;C. Bake in middle rack for about 20 minutes for 9x5" loaf pan. Adjust time if the loaf is of different size or shape. If there is too much browning, the bread can be covered in tin foil for some time while being baked.


## Variations

* Ideally, use bread flour, but all-purpose works just as well.
* Water can be partially or entirely replaced by milk and/or cream and/or most other liquid, but pay attention to the fat content -- fat weakens the gluten network, which holds air and makes bread fluffy, so make sure the total fat is not over 5% of flour weight.
* You can use any fat/oil and sugar/sweetener.
