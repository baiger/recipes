# Pepperoni

## Warning
Food poisoning can be life threatening. To mitigate risks, keep the meat temperature as low as possible; do not skip the nitrite (Cure #1); cook the sausage to an internal temperature of 71&deg;C before eating.

## Ingredients
For 1kg meat:
* Pork shoulder 700g (or more)
* Beef chuck 300g (or less, total 1kg)
* Salt 23g
* Cure #1 2.5g
* Sugar 10g
* Black pepper 3g
* Smoked paprika 8g
* Fennel seeds 2.5g
* Allspice 2g
* Cayenne 2g
* Yogurt 16g (or water)
* Liquid smoke as needed (optional)
* Sausage casing as needed

## Method
Finely grind or chop meat. Finely grind spices or use ground ones. Mix meat with the rest of the ingredients. Stuff the sausage. Store the sausages, with a breathable cover (paper towel or cloth), in the fridge for 24 hours -- the meat will be cured during this time. Poach the cured sausages in 80&deg;C water for a time determined by their diameter(s): roughly 10 minutes per cm, up to 6cm (cooking time needs to increase beyond that point). Sausages should be submerged in the water bath. After poaching, let the sausage cool and air dry. Refrigerate for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
