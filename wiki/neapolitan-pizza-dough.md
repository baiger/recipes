## Ratio
See [baker's percentage](bakers-percentage).
* Flour 100%
* Water 70%
* Salt 3%
* Yeast 0.2%

## Method
Mix all the ingredients. Cover the dough and let it sit in [room temperature], about 20&deg;C, for 24 hours. Split the dough into smaller balls, each to make one pizza, and refrigiate for an additional 24-96 hours. Return the dough to room temperature an hour before building and baking pizzas.

## Pizza Size and Dough Weight

Generally, you want the edge of the pizza to be a bit thicker. Empirical data suggests about 1.5g of dough per square inch of pie plus about 3-5g per inch of rind.
