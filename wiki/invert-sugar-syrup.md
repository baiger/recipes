# Invert Sugar Syrup

## Ingredients
By weight:
* Sugar 1000 parts
* Citric acid 1 part (or 20-50 parts lemon juice)
* Water ~400 parts
* (Optional) Baking soda, up to 1.3 parts to adjust pH

## Method

Mixing everything except baking soda in a pot. Bring to a boil on medium heat; stir constantly. Remove from heat when desired consistency is achieved (be aware that cooled syrup will thicken significantly). For consistent results, insert a candy thermometer and remove from heat when the syrup reaches 114°C (237°F).

If you want to adjust the pH, add desired amount of baking soda after the syrup is removed from heat and stir to dissolve.
