# Egg Drop Soup

## Ingredients

* 1-1.5L water
* Vegetable of your choice
* 1 egg

### Vegetables and Other Variations

Egg drop soup is often made with tomatoes, seaweed, or spinach, but your options are not limited to those. Another food that resembles egg drop soup is sweet rice wine ("jiuniang") cooked with ginger and egg. Arguably some of the porridges are egg drop soups, too.

## Method

Beat egg in a small bowl. Set aside.

Cook vegetables how you would a regular vegetable soup (remember to season it). After the soup is done, bring it to a boil, remove it from heat, and immediately pour the beaten egg slowly into the soup while swirling it around quickly with a ladle.

The egg will be cooked by the hot soup; it will also cool the soup down slightly to prevent overcooking. If you overcook the egg, it will lose the silk-like texture sought after in an egg drop soup.
