## Variations

* Ideally, use bread flour, but all-purpose works just as well.
* Water can be partially or entirely replaced by milk and/or cream and/or most other liquid, but pay attention to the fat content -- fat weakens the gluten network, which holds air and makes bread fluffy, so make sure the total fat is not over 5% of flour weight.
* You can use any fat/oil and sugar/sweetener.
