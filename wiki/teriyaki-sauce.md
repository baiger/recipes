# Teriyaki sauce

## Ratio

* 4 parts **(rice) cooking wine**
* 2 parts **(light) soy sauce**
* 1 part **sugar**

## Method

Mix everything in a pot. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the sauce over medium heat to desired flavour and consistency.

## Variations

* Naturally, you can use any sugar (or even sweetener) and soy sauce you like.
* If you want to add dark soy sauce, you do NOT need to adjust the amount of light soy sauce here, since dark soy sauce isn't very salty.
* Since this originated from Japan, "cooking wine" refers to rice wines, such as *sake* and *mirin*. It's a key flavour in this recipe, and substituting other wines will significantly change its character; hence it's not recommended.
* To shorten the cooking time, starch can be used to thicken the sauce. You may need to add some salt and sugar to compensate for the extra water content. Alcohol intolerant people should avoid this method, though, because the residual alcohol content can be high without extended simmering.
