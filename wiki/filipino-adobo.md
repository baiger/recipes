# Filipino Adobo


## Ingredients

* 1 kg chicken
* soy sauce
* vinegar
* garlic cloves, minced
* water
* brown sugar
* salt
* whole peppercorn
* dried bay leaves

## Method

Mix 2 parts soy sauce to 1 parts vinegar (6 tablespoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons vinegar for example), and add garlic to make a marinade. Marinate the chicken for 1 - 3 hours in the refrigerator.

When ready, heat up oil in a deep pan and carefully place chicken to brown. This may take a few minutes.

Slowly begin to pour the rest of the marinade and add water (~1 cup) and bring to a boil.

Add in a few bay leaves, salt, and whole peppercorn and leave to simmer until chicken is tender. (Half an hour maybe).

At this point, periodically check from time to time if it needs more sauce. Add a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, water as needed.

When chicken is tender, add some brown sugar and simmer for a few more minutes.

Remove from heat.
