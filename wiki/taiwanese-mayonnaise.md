# Taiwanese Mayonnaise

This is named so because it originated as a type of emulsified salad dressing, whose method resembles that of mayonnaise, popular for meat sandwiches in Taiwan. The major difference from mayonnaise is that it uses sugar and salt to season the sauce and is whipped with whole eggs.

Some people used egg white only to make this sauce, but I have not personally tested the recipe, so I cannot speak on the emulsion stability of egg white alone. Some sources hint that starches are added as a stabilizer in case egg yolks are absent. To try the egg white version, reduce oil by half. Gentle heating may also help with the stability.

**Caution: raw eggs carry risk of Salmonella contamination even if shells are clean and intact. For your safety, [pasteurize eggs](egg-pasteurization) before use.**

## Ingredients

* 1 whole egg, size does not matter
* Neutral oil 400-500ml
* Sugar 80g
* Salt 4g
* (Optional) lemon or lime juice, half to 1 fruit (
* (Optional) MSG 1g
