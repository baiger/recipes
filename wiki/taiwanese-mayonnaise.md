# Taiwanese Mayonnaise

This is named so because it originated as a type of emulsified salad dressing, whose method resembles that of mayonnaise, popular for meat sandwiches in Taiwan. The major difference from mayonnaise is that it uses sugar and salt to season the sauce and is whipped with whole eggs.

Some people used egg white only to make this sauce, but I have not personally tested the recipe, so I cannot speak on the emulsion stability of egg white alone. Some sources hint that starches are added as a stabilizer in case egg yolks are absent. To try the egg white version, reduce oil by half. Gentle heating may also help with the stability.

**Caution: raw eggs carry risk of Salmonella contamination even if shells are clean and intact. For your safety, [pasteurize eggs](egg-pasteurization) before use.**

## Ingredients

* 1 whole egg, size does not matter
* Neutral oil 400-500ml; adjust for the desired consistency
* Sugar 80-100g
* Salt 4-6g
* (Optional) lemon or lime juice, half to 1 fruit (15-50ml); adjust for the desired consistency
* (Optional) MSG 1g

## Method

Beat the egg with dry ingredients until they dissolve and the egg mixture is foamy. Add oil, one tablespoon at a time, and beat until fully absorbed after each addition. The sauce will gradually thicken.

Adjust consistency by adding oil or water phase (water, lemon juice, whipping cream, etc): more oil = more viscous sauce but also more translucent in appearance.

Store in refrigerator and use, ideally, within a week (make smaller batches if you have trouble consuming the sauce in a short time -- simply cut everything except the egg proportionally).
