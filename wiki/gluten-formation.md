# Gluten Formation

"Gluten" here refers to the wheat gluten, which consists of glutenin and gliadin proteins. These proteins form disulfide bonds and bind to each other to form a web-like structure, called the gluten network, after they absorb water. This chemical reaction starts immediately after water is added to flour.
