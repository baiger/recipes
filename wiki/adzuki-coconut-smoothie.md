# Adzuki Coconut Smoothie

## Sweet Adzuki Beans
Soak and cook like other [dry beans](pulses), but don't add anything in the cooking water except sugar and an optional pinch of salt. You need about 1 part of sugar per 2 parts of dry beans.

## Ingredients
* 1 part sweet adzuki beans
* 1 part coconut milk (5% fat)
* Optional water/milk/syrup to adjust flavour and texture
* Optional ice cubes

## Method
Blend all the ingredients together. Sieve for a smoother texture.
