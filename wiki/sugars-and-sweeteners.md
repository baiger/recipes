# Sugars and Sweeteners

In this article, sugars refer to culinary additives that consist mainly of mono- and disaccharides. They taste sweet and, like other carbs, supply 4.2 kcal/g of energy.

Sweeteners, in this article, are sweet additives that are not included in the above category. Artificial or natural, sweeteners generally provide a lot fewer calories than sugars.

## Nutrition

Sugars are not significantly different in their nutritional values. They only contain trace amount of micronutrients. At the amount they're normally consumed, the amounts of micronutrients make little difference. Unrefined sugars (e.g., cane sugar) are not better than refined sugars (e.g., granulated white sugar) in this regard.

Sweeteners generally provide significantly less energy at the same sweetness level compared with sugars. The micronutrients they contain, if any, are also trace amounts at best.

These substances don't metabolize the same way. Glucose can be directly used by cells, while fructose has to be processed in the liver.
