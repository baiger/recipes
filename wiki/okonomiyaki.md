# Okonomiyaki

This recipe references and simplifies <https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki/>.

## Sauce Substitutes

### Kewpie Mayo
* 4 parts Mayonnaise
* 1 part (Dijon) mustard

### Okonomiyaki Sauce
* 4 parts ketchup
* 3 parts Worcestershire sauce
* 2 parts oyster sauce
* 1 part sugar

## Pancakes

For every 9" okonomiyaki:

### Batter

* 50g flour
* 100g water
* 75g thinly sliced cabbage
* 25g thinly sliced onion
* 1g salt
* 1g bonito flakes

Additional ingredients such as seafood can be added to the batter. However, the amount of flour, water, and salt must be adjusted if you add more than 50g per pancake. To maintain the integrity of the pancake during flipping and cutting, it's the best for the size of additional ingredient pieces to not exceed a cube with 1/4" (0.5cm) edges.

### Toppings

* 50g sliced bacon
* 1g bonito flakes
* 1g nori flakes
* 1 egg

## Cooking & Assembling

Cook bacon in a flat pan on medium high heat. Add batter and flatten into a pancake when the bacon sizzles and turns translucent. Flip the pancake when the batter has solidified and the bottom is browned, about 5 minutes. Cook for another 3 minutes or until the other side is well browned.

Transfer the pancake into a plate and cover with a sunny side down egg (meaning a sunny side up egg, but flipped on the pancake). Top with bonito and nori flakes and both sauces.
