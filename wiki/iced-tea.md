# Iced Tea

## Ingredients
* 4-5 tea bags or tsps of tea
* 2 tsps mint leaves
* 2 citrus fruit's equivalence of juice
* 1L of water
* Sweeteners of choice, to taste

## Methods
### Cold Brew
Mix everything except sweetner and store, covered, in the fridge. Brew for 4-6 hours for green or white tea and 8-12 hours for black or oolong tea. Take the tea bags out and add sweetener either directly to the pot or individually when served.

### Sun Tea
Like cold brew, but place the pot under the sun and cut the time by half.

### Hot Brew
Brew the tea and mint leaves per hot tea instructions with half as much water. Take the tea bags out and add citrus. Add the rest of the water in the form of ice cubes. Sweeten to your liking.
