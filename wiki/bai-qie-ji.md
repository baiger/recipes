# Bai Qie Ji (Cantonese Poached Chicken)

## Ingredients
* 1 whole chicken (about 3-4 lbs)
* 6 slices ginger
* 1 stalk of green onion (optional)
* 0.5% (weight) salt water, enough to cover the chicken in pot

## Method

Combine salt water and herbs in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Turn the burner off. Lower the chicken into the pot to let it completely soak in water bath. Do *not* cover the pot. Flip the chicken, bring water to a boil a second time 30 minutes later, and again turn the burner off and let chicken soak. If your chicken is large (4lbs or higher), you need to repeat the boiling-soaking cycle at least one more time.

The chicken is done when no blood comes out when you insert a knife into the leg. It's normal for the bones to be still red inside. If you prefer tighter skin, soak the cooked chicken in an ice water bath for a couple of minutes. Serve the chicken, and save the broth for other cooking purposes.
