# Japanese Curry Block

## Ingredients
Roux:
- butter 90g
- flour 90-120g

Spices:
- oil, enough to toast the spices
- spice powder (you can use readily mixed curry powder or mix yourself), 1/2 cup
- salt, optional, up to 5 tsps
- onion, 1 large
- garlic, 1 head
- ginger, about the same size as garlic, peeled

Apple sauce:
- apple, 1 large

## Method

Blend onion, garlic, and ginger together. Toast spice powder until fragrant, and add the onion garlic ginger mixture. Mix well. Set aside.

Blend peeled, cored apple. Cook the apple sauce over low heat until it's no longer watery. Set aside.

Make roux by cooking flour in butter on low heat. Then add apple sauce and spice mixture. Mix well. Shape and cut into 9-10 squares. Freeze the squares until ready to use.

## Usage

Each square can be dissolved in 500ml of water to make curry sauce. Add more salt as needed during cooking.
