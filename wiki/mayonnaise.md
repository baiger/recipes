# Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion traditionally made with vegetable oil, egg yolk, and some acid such as lemon juice or wine vinegar.

## Ingredients

* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tbsp mustard (optional)
* 1 tbsp lemon juice (or wine vinegar)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup vegetable oil

## Method

Let all the ingredients come to room temperature.

Whisk the egg yolk, salt, and mustard slightly. Starting with 1 tbsp of oil each time (typically, you can safely add as much oil, volume wise, as egg yolk, but starting slow is unlikely to fail), whisk until the oil is completely incorporated into egg yolk mixture. Repeat. Whenever the sauce thickens to scoopable, add more vinegar/water/lemon juice based on your desired flavour.

## Notes

### Storage & Shelf Life

If not used immediately, mayonnaise should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for no more than 3 days (avoid making too much since it cannot be frozen -- it will separate). Do not use metal containers unless you know it won't react with the acid.

### Flavour

Untreated olive oil (or mustard oil) causes a slightly bitter taste in mayo. Moreover, these water-soluble bitter compounds are said to destabilize the emulsion. To avoid it, use all or mostly [neutral oils](neutral-oil); alternatively, pour boiling water into olive oil (or mustard oil), shake the mixture, let it sit, and then separate the oil and water phases. The science behind this treatment method is explained in <https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/10/how-to-debitter-olive-oil.html>.

### Emulsion Stability

Egg yolk contains a variety of molecules that exhibit surface activity, including lecithin and lipoproteins. The emulsifying property is usually attributed to lecithin, but the proteins also play a role.

The separation of oil and water phases is the most frequent problem with traditional mayonnaise, particularly when it experiences sharp temperature change such as refrigeration. If that happens, you can usually re-emulsify the mixture slowly into a new egg yolk or heavy cream (cream is itself an oil-in-water emulsion). Too thick an emulsion may also break more easily.

James Peterson, in his book *Sauces*, introduces a sous vide method to "stabilize" the mayonnaise: cooking the egg yolks in a 60&deg;C water bath for 30 minutes before whipping the sauce. This method also pasteurizes the egg yolk, making the mayonnaise safer. He also suggests 1-2% additional lecithin for a more stable emulsion.

Other emulsion stabilizers can be considered. They are usually either emulsifiers or thickeners. Salt in the recipe can also help maintaining the repulsion between dispersed oil droplets through the electric charges of ions, but too much salt can also destabilize the emulsion.


### Ratio

One egg yolk can emulsify up to 10L of oil, therefore you can increase the amount of oil without changing the amount of egg yolk, but you may end up with a less stable emulsion. Also, the right viscosity is achieved by an oil-to-water ratio of about 4:1; therefore, add about 1 tbsp of water (or lemon juice or vinegar) per 1/4 cup of additional oil.
