# Dumplings

## Wrap

Dumpling wrap doughs are similar to noodle doughs, so if you're comfortable handling them, you can make dumpling wraps from scratch; otherwise, store-bought wraps are a decent substitute.

If you use store-bought dumpling wraps, you need to wet their inner edges slightly to make them stick to themselves; to do so, prepare a small bowl of water, dip your finger in the water, and wipe the water on the inner edge of a wrap immediately before you fold it.

Ingredients of dumpling wrap dough:
* All-purpose flour 100%
* Water 46%
* Salt 1%

## Filling

You have a lot of freedom in what you put inside a dumpling. Traditional fillings usually consist of a protein and one or more vegetables; vegan dumplings are occasionally made, too. For example:
* Pork and cabbage
* Shrimp and Chinese leek (garlic chives)
* Egg and tomato
* Cabbage, carrot, shiitake, and vermicelli

Spices, salt, sugar, and soy sauce are often used to flavour the fillings. Cooking wine is not recommended because the alcohol cannot escape the dumplings during cooking and may result in unpleasant taste. Water, oil, and starch are often added to enhance the texture.

Here is a simple formula for dumpling fillings that my family uses:
* Ground meat and finely chopped vegetables
* Salt
* Five spice powder
* Starch water
* Oil

More steps can be taken to make the fillings better. See discussions below.

### Spices and Herbs

Regularly used spices and herbs include
* Sichuan pepper
* Black/white pepper
* Cinnamon
* Star anise
* Fennel seeds
* Bay leaves
* Tsaoko (looks like black cardamom and nutmeg but tastes a bit different)
* Ginger
* Green onion

Biting into a chunk of spice or herb in dumplings would be unpleasant. Therefore they are usually incorporated into the filling as powders or infused water/oil.

### Ground Meat

It is important to stir the meat in one direction so that the meat binds to itself through fibres. Starch water is often added to ground meat to improve the binding.

Spice infused water (up to 50% meat weight) and oil (up to 10%) can be added to the meat to improve its texture. Remember to add them in small amounts each time and stir in one direction until fully absorbed.

### Vegetables

Vegetables may release their water content after coming into contact with salt. A watery filling is undesirable. Therefore, vegetables are often processed in one or more of the following ways to minimize water release:
* Salted and water squeezed out
* Dressed in small amount of oil before mixing with salty ingredients
* Parboiled
* Finely chopped or grated

## Folding Methods

The most important thing is to close the dumplings tightly and without too much air trapped inside. The folds are decorative in nature.

(I'll add folding methods later since they're less important.)

## Cooking Methods

Dumplings are usually boiled, steamed, or pan-fried. The cooking time in this section are for regular sized dumplings (~30g each) only.

### Boiling

Bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add dumplings. When the water boils again, add about 1/4 cups of cold water; repeat twice more. When the water boils again, the dumplings are done.

### Steaming

Steam the dumplings for 10-15 minutes after the water is boiling.

### Pan-Frying

Start with hot pan and cold oil on medium heat. Swirl each dumpling in oil a bit to prevent sticking. After all the dumplings are placed in the pan, add a spoonful of water and cover the pan immediately. Let the dumplings cook for 5-7 minutes, covered. The bottom of the dumplings should be golden brown when they're done.

## Sauce
