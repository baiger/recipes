# Dumplings

## Wrap

Dumpling wrap doughs are similar to noodle doughs, so if you're comfortable handling them, you can make dumpling wraps from scratch; otherwise, store-bought wraps are a decent substitute.

If you use store-bought dumpling wraps, you need to wet their inner edges slightly to make it stick to itself; to do so, prepare a small bowl of water, dip your finger in the water, and wipe the water on the inner edge of the wrap immediately before you fold it.

Ingredients of dumpling wrap dough:
* All-purpose flour 100%
* Water 46%
* Salt 1%

## Filling

You have a lot of freedom in what you put inside a dumpling. Traditional fillings usually consist of a protein and one or more vegetables; vegan dumplings are occasionally made, too. For example:
* Pork and cabbage
* Shrimp and Chinese leek (garlic chives)
* Egg and tomato
* Cabbage, carrot, shiitake, and vermicelli

Spices, salt, sugar, and soy sauce are often used to flavour the fillings. Cooking wine is not recommended because the alcohol cannot escape the dumplings during cooking and may result in unpleasant taste. Water, oil, and starch are often added to enhance the texture.

Here is a simple formula for dumpling fillings that my family uses:
* Ground meat and finely chopped vegetables
* Salt
* Five spice powder
* Starch water
* Oil

More steps can be taken to make the fillings better. See discussions below.

### Spices

Most often 

### Ground Meat



### Vegetables

Vegetables may release their water content after coming into contact with salt. A watery filling is undesirable. Therefore, vegetables are often processed in one or more of the following ways to minimize water release:
* Salted and water squeezed out
* Dressed in small amount of oil before mixing with salty ingredients
* Parboiled
* Finely chopped or grated
