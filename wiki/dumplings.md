# Dumplings

## Wrap

Dumpling wrap doughs are similar to noodle doughs, so if you're comfortable handling them, you can make dumpling wraps from scratch; otherwise, store-bought wraps are a decent substitute. If you use store-bought dumpling wraps, you need to wet their inner edges slightly to make it stick to itself; to do so, prepare a small bowl of water, dip your finger in the water, and wipe the water on the inner edge of the wrap immediately before you fold it.

Ingredients of dumpling wrap dough:
* All-purpose flour 100%
* Water 46%
* Salt 1%
