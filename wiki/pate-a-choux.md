# Pâte À Choux (Choux Pastry)

## Ingredients
* 250g water
* 120g butter, sliced
* 4g sugar
* 3g salt
* 125g flour, sifted
* 4 large eggs

## Method
Mix water, butter, sugar, and salt in a pot over medium heat. Stir until butter is completely melted. Bring the mixture to a simmer and add all the flour. Stir vigorously and constantly to fully incorporate the flour. Remove from heat once the dough starts to form a film at the bottom of the pot, within about 3 minutes.

Let the dough cool to lukewarm before adding the eggs, one at a time. Stir to fully incorporate the egg before adding the next. The dough will thin to a consistency that's of a cookie dough and can be piped. To check, lift spatula from dough, the tip of the dough on the spatula should slowly drift down. Adjust the amount of eggs for the right consistency.

Baking temperature and time have to be adjusted for shapes and sizes. Please refer to pages of individual recipes.

## Variations
Water in the recipe can be replaced by similar liquids such as milk.
