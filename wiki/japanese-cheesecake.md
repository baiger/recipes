# Japanese Cheesecake

This recipe is adapted from <https://youtu.be/SyM3jMFjess>.

The following amounts yields about 5 cups (75 cubic inch) of batter. The cake can rise to more than 150% the initial height, so make sure you leave a little space in the cake mould.

## Ingredients
* Cream cheese 160g
* Butter 35g
* Milk 60g
* Flavouring 3-5g
* 3 large eggs
* Cake flour 30g
* Sugar 40g
* Vinegar 3g

## Method
Separate egg yolks and egg whites.

Melt cream cheese, butter, and milk in a boiling water bath. Stir in egg yolks and any flavouring. Stir in sifted cake flour and remove from heat immediately once the liquid starts to thicken. Keep stirring for another minute.

Beat egg white to soft-peak [meringue](meringue) with vinegar and sugar.

*The meringue should be of similar "thickness" to the cheese batter for optimal mixing.*

Carefully mix meringue into cheese batter in three batches.

Bake at 250 &deg;F in a water bath for about 60 minutes, until a knife inserted into cake centre comes out clean.

## Flavour Variations
Flavouring should almost always go into the cheese batter before being mixed with meringue. Extracts can be added while making meringue, but mixing them with the cheese batter is easier.

You can add liquid extract directly to the cheese batter. If you want to use powders such as cocoa or matcha, start with ~5g of powder for the above amounts. You may need to reduce the amount of cake flour or cooking time to adjust for the consistency.
