# Pulses

Pulses are all kinds of edible bean seeds.

In China, pulses are classified into "large beans" that are rich in fat and protein and "little beans" that are starchy. The first category is roughly equivalent to soy beans and can be used to make a range of soy products such as soy milk and tofu. The second category are sometimes made into paste as fillings in baked goods. Pulses within the same category are very similar to each other in micronutrient contents and texture, and all of them can be incorporated into a variety of recipes.

Canned pulses are cooked and good for when you forget to plan it ahead; otherwise, cooking from dry pulses is cheaper. Do not buy canned lentils since they can be cooked from dry in half an hour.

## Soaking

Soak 1 part dry pulses in 3 parts water (volume) overnight. Discard excessive water.

## Cooking

### Soy milk, bean curd, & tofu

Blend the soy beans with 2 parts water and filter the liquid before boiling.

To make bean curd or tofu, add coagulant to boiled soy milk. Bean curd will appear shortly. Squeeze out water to make tofu of desired firmness.

### Others

Pour the soaked pulses into a big pot. Add 2 parts water. Flavour the water to your liking:
* Salt: slightly saltier than you would like, unless the pulses are intended for desserts;
* Olive oil;
* Herbs: bay leaves, thyme, parsley stems, fennel, etc.

Bring water to a boil and then simmer until cooked through. This typically needs 1-2 hours, depending on the size (bigger pulses generally need longer to cook). Skim foam occasionally.

Test for doneness near the end of prescribed cooking time. You should taste a few cooked pulses to see if the whole pot is cooked through. Pulses should be totally soft when they're done.
