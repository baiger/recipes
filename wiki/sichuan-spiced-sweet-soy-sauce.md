# Sichuan Spiced Sweet Soy Sauce

## Ingredients

Note: there are typically three types of soy sauce -- light, dark, and regular. This recipe calls for regular soy sauce. If you can't find it, you can also substitute with a half-half mixture of light and dark soy sauce.

* Regular soy sauce 1000g
* Brown sugar 400g
* Ginger 20g
* Green onion 20g (or 1 stalk)
* Dried spices
   * Fennel seeds 3g
   * Star anise 1g (about 2)
   * Bay leaves 1g (about 4)
   * Cinnamon 1g
   * Sichuan pepper 0.5g
   * 1 tsaoko fruit, broken
   * 1 whole clove

## Method

Mix everything on medium-low heat. Simmer until the liquid is about 2/3 in volume. Filter into a container and store in the fridge.
