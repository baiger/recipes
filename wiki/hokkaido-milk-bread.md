# Hokkaido Milk Bread

## Bulk Fermentation Stage

### Straight Dough with Autolyse

#### Ingredients
* All-purpose or bread flour 300g
* Milk 130g
* Whipping cream 30g
* Sugar 40g
* Large eggs 1
* Sugar tolerant yeast 2.5g
* Salt 5g
* Butter 25g

Total hydration is ~75%. Bakes one 9x5 loaf.

#### Method

Mix everything except salt and butter together until no visible dry flour remains. Let it rest for 30 minutes to an hour in room temperature, or refrigerate for up to a day (this is the autolyse step).

Soften butter in room temperature an hour before the next step.

Add salt and start kneading until the dough forms a cohesive ball and start to get stretchy. If kneading by stand mixer, this takes about 5-10 minutes; if kneading by hand, the easiest method is to use a dough scraper to cut the dough and scrape bits together. Add softened butter and continue to knead until the dough is satisfactorily smooth and can be easily stretched to a thin layer before breaking (windowpane test; many recipes ask for a film so thin that it is translucent, but that is not strictly necessary). If kneading by a stand mixer, this takes 10-20 minutes depending on your desired outcome; if kneading by hand, the trick is to slap the dough onto the working surface to stretch it and then fold it back, repeatedly.

Smooth the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap or wet towel, and let it rise to twice as big (about an hour to two depending on your room temperature).

## Shaping and Baking

Preheat oven to 185&deg;C (375&deg;F).

Dust the dough with some flour. Gently deflate. Divide the dough into three equal portions. With a rolling pin, flatten each portion into a rectangle and then roll the rectangle into a coil; repeat once on the perpendicular direction. Alternatively, simply shape each portion into a smooth ball.

Brush the inside of a 9x5 loaf pan with oil and place the shaped dough portions inside. COver and let it rise to 50% bigger, for about 45 minutes.

Bake for 25-30 minutes in the middle rack. If the bread is browning too quickly, you can cover it with foil for half of the time.
