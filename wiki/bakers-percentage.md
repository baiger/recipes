# Baker's Percentage
---

A recipe can be written down with different units, but the ratio between ingredients would remain the same. Baker's percentage is a system for flour-based recipes, which involves no specific units, but represents the weight of each ingredient *as a percentage of the flour weight*. For example, the following is a [ciabatta recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/pro/formulas/ciabatta) written in weight and baker's percentage.

| Ingredient | Weight | Baker's % |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Flour      | 10kg   | 100%      |
| Water      | 7.6kg  | 76%       |
| Salt       | 0.2kg  | 2%        |
| Yeast      | 0.12kg | 1.2%      |

## Advantages
First of all, measuring ingredients by weight is more accurate than by volume in baking. Powder ingredients, like flour, can be packed tightly or loosely; therefore, if measured by volume, an undetermined amount of space is occupied by air. Difference in temperature will also affect the volume. Therefore baker's percentage is strictly *by weight*.

Secondly, baker's percentage makes it easy to scale up and down the quantities of recipes. Simply determine the amount of flour needed, and the weight of everything else can be calculated as **flour weight**<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\times">**baker's percentage**.
