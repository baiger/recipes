# Layered Pancakes

## Ingredients
* Dough
   * All-purpose flour 100%
   * Water 67%
* For each 8" pancake
   * Dough 55g
   * Oil-rich filling 2 tbsps, or for traditional scallion oil pancakes
      * Salt 1.5g
      * Neutral oil 7g
      * Green onion, minced, 2 tbsps

## Method

Mix and knead the dough to a slightly sticky, very elastic mass. Dust with flour and divide into portions. Form each portion into a ball.

Roll one portion out to about 2mm in thickness. Spread the filling evenly. Roll from one end up to form a log. Seal the ends and twist the log gently 4 to 5 times. Roll the two ends horizontally until they meet. Put one end on top of the other and press down with your palm firmly and gently to form a 1" thick disk shape dough.

Put one such dough on a hot nonstick pan (or greased regular pan). Press  down on it with chopsticks on a flat spatula until it reaches the desired thickness (usually 3-4mm). Flip when the down side is golden brown. Loosen the layers by squishing the pancake horizontally with chopsticks. Flip and loosen the layers again when the second side is also golden brown.
